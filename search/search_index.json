As the underlying variational quantum circuit (VQC) can be represented by Fourier series that contain an exponentially large spectrum in the number of input features, hope for quantum advantage remains. Nevertheless, it remains an open problem if and how quantum Fourier models (QFMs) can concretely outperform classical alternatives, as the eventual sources of non-classical computational power (for instance, the role of entanglement) are far from being fully understood. Likewise, hardware noise continues to pose a challenge that will persist also along the path towards fault tolerant quantum computers.</p> <p>In this work, we study VQCs with Fourier lenses, which provides possibilities to improve their understanding, while also illuminating and quantifying constraints and challenges. We seek to elucidate critical characteristics of QFMs under the influence of noise. Specifically, we undertake a systematic investigation into the impact of noise on the Fourier spectrum, expressibility, and entangling capability of QFMs through extensive numerical simulations and link these properties to training performance. The insights may inform more efficient utilisation of quantum hardware and support the design of tailored error mitigation and correction strategies.</p> <p>Decoherence imparts an expected and broad detrimental influence across all Ans\u00e4tze. Nonetheless, we observe that the severity of these deleterious effects varies among different model architectures, suggesting that certain configurations may exhibit enhanced robustness to noise and show computational utility.</p>"},{"location":"coefficients/","title":"Coefficients","text":"<p>The resulting plots of our experiments as PDF can be found in plotting/rplots/img-gen, while a PNG version can be found on this website.</p>"},{"location":"coefficients/#summary","title":"Summary","text":"<p>Our Figure 16 in the paper summarised the coefficient mean \\(\\mu_c(\\boldsymbol{\\omega})\\) for 1D (\\(R_X\\) and \\(R_Y\\) encoding), and 2D (\\(R_X R_Y\\) encoding) inputs and all qubits, only depicting the zero and maximum frequency-coefficient, shown here:  </p> <p>Absolute coefficient mean \\(\\mu_c(\\boldsymbol{\\omega})\\) for the lowest frequency \\(\\boldsymbol{\\omega}=\\boldsymbol{0}\\) and highest frequency \\(\\boldsymbol{\\omega} = \\boldsymbol{\\omega}_\\text{max}\\) in the respective spectrum under the influence of varying noise levels.
