# Entanglement

## For Pure States
Our Figure 12 in the paper:
![Entanglement](figures/ent_mw_light.png#only-light)
![Entanglement](figures/ent_mw_dark.png#only-dark)

Average Meyer-Wallach (MW) entanglement over randomly sampled parameters for the considered ans√§tze in a noiseless environment. The bars represent the mean values with error bars from the minimum to maximum highlighted in red across the five seeds.


## For Mixed States
Our Figure 13 in the paper:
![Entanglement](figures/ent_light.png#only-light)
![Entanglement](figures/ent_dark.png#only-dark)

Meyer-Wallach (MW) entangling capability and Entanglement of Formation (EF) under the influence of increasing noise levels. Points represent the mean of five seeds and lines are a linear interpolation to guide the eye. Shaded areas present the minimum/maximum entanglement across the five seeds. As the difference between seeds is small, it is not visible in the plot.
