# Expressibility

Our Figure 11 in the paper:
![Expressibility](figures/expr_light.png#only-light)

Average Expressibility (i.e., inverse of the KL divergence) over randomly sampled parameters under the influence of increasing noise levels. The points represent the mean and the shaded areas around it refer to the minimum and maximum across all five seeds, which is negligible in most cases as we chose a sufficiently large number of samples.
